## Breaking

- **MD040 is now enabled** in the shared `.markdownlint.jsonc`. Every fenced code
  block must carry a language tag. On upgrade, consumers with untagged fences
  will fail markdownlint until those blocks are labelled (`text`, `console`, or
  `plaintext` for language-less samples).

## Changed

- Re-enabled MD040 with a rewritten rationale documenting the
  `text` / `console` / `plaintext` convention ([A-928](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-928)); bumped the audit date.
- Tagged the language-less tree listing in `infrastructure/README.md` as `text`.
